# store tuple in variable called my_tuple and populate with elements 'tamara', 'blackpanther', and 'wilmart'
my_tuple = ('tamara', 'blackpanther', 'wilmart')

# store tuple in variable called new_tuple and populate with contents of my_tuple
new_tuple = my_tuple

# set new_tuple equal to my_tuple index 0
new_tuple = my_tuple[0]

# set new_tuple equal to my_tuple last index
new_tuple = my_tuple[-1]

# set new_tuple equal to my_tuple indices 1 through 2
new_tuple = my_tuple[1:3]

# set new_tuple equal to my_tuple start of index through end of index excluding last element
new_tuple = my_tuple[-3:-1]
